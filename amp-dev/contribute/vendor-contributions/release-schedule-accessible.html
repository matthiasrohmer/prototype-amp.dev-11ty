<p>This interactive page describes the process via which new code that is merged into the <a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml">amphtml GitHub repository</a> progresses through time to reach publishers, developers, and end-users.</p>
<p>For a detailed description of the various release channels, see <a href="/content/amp-dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/spec/release-schedule.md">AMP Release Schedule</a>. There is also a <a href="./release-schedule.html">visual</a> (not screen-reader accessible) version of this page.</p>
