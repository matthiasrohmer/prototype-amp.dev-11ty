          Caching Working Group members will use `#wg-caching` channel on AMP's
          Slack
          ([signup](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd83J2IZA6cdR6jPwABGsJE8YL4pkypAbKMGgUZZriU7Qu6Tg/viewform?fbzx=4406980310789882877))
          for real-time discussion. The channel is open to anyone, regardless of
          membership in UI working group. However, support is better suited to
          the `#caching-discuss`, `#signed-exchanges`, and `#validator-discuss`
          channels.
