  The Foundation Onboarding Working Group is responsible for ensuring the
  successful completion of the OpenJS Foundation's onboarding process. For more
  context, see the [AMP
  announcement](https://blog.amp.dev/2019/10/10/amp-is-joining-the-openjs-foundation-incubation-program/)
  and [OpenJS Foundation
  announcement](https://openjsf.org/blog/2019/10/10/openjs-foundation-welcomes-amp-project-to-help-improve-user-experience-on-the-web/)
  of AMP joining the OpenJS Foundation's incubation program. To graduate from
  the incubation program, AMP must complete the [onboarding
  checklist](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/350).
  The WG maintains an org-level [project
  board](https://github.com/orgs/ampproject/projects/4) to track all issues
  related to this effort. The tentative date for graduation is December 10,
  2019.
