    headline: Solution
    text: AMP hit WompMobile’s radar in 2015. “It was a pause-worthy moment in our evolution,” Gara recalls. “AMP offered the ability to combine blazing speed with rich functionality.”<br><br>WompMobile integrated AMP into their proprietary development platform and now converts complex websites into beautiful AMP sites—like portero.com and campmor.com—leveraging their clients’ existing IT infrastructure, including checkout systems. Newly-created AMP pages remain automatically synchronized with their desktop counterparts. And the AMP format enables WompMobile to build pages that always contain the essential e-commerce elements, including product specs, brand attributes, product photos, and more. “AMP was the perfect addition to our business, giving us a new level of impact for our e-commerce clients,” notes Gara.
