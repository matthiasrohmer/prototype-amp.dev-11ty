    headline: Solution
    text: The organization partnered with Google to test AMP pages on its membership landing page for the search term “AARP.” In May 2019, AARP used drafts and experiments in its Google Ads account to test performance between AMP and non-AMP membership pages. The organization split its traffic evenly between the two pages to compare mobile conversions, and it paused its responsive search ads during testing to ensure that results could be attributed solely to AMP.
