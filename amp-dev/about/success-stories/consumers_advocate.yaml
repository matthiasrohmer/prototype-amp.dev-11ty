    headline: Solution
    text: "The Puerto Rico-based organization had two goals for improving their site’s performance: lowering the bounce rate on their most-visited pages and increasing conversion rates from their AdWords campaigns. After seeing a number news articles about AMP, ConsumersAdvocate.org learned that AMP could help speed up their site and improve conversion rates. They decided to test the framework, and after about a week of in-house development, they began replacing their existing mobile webpages with AMP pages.<br><br>“We implemented AMP for sections of our site that drove views and business value, namely reviews of pet insurance and home-security systems,” CEO Greg Powel. “It made sense to test AMP on our most valuable content to see if it led to an increase in time on site and conversion rates.”"

    headline: Results
    text: AMP implementation on ConsumersAdvocate.org resulted in as much as a 30% reduction in bounce rate, a 3x increase in page load speeds, and a 5-10% increase in conversion rates on pages linked from their Google AdWords campaigns—“an overall win-win for user experience and monetization,” Powel says. “Higher conversion rates mean users are spending time reading our content and finding value.” Site visitors now spend as much as 30% longer on the AMP pages.<br><br>The ConsumersAdvocate.org team remains excited about the future of AMP. “Improvements to the user experience and page-load speeds are definitely the biggest advantages,” Powel concludes. “We plan to roll out AMP more widely across our site.”
