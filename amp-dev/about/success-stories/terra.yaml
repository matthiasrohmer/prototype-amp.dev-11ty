    headline: Solution
    text: As an online media provider in an increasingly mobile world, Terra’s ability to deliver fast-loading, easy-to-read pages, especially on smartphones, is critical to their success. “More than 60 percent of our traffic in the last six months came from mobile” said Guilherme Moser de Souza, a Senior Systems Analyst for Terra.<br><br>To meet the demand from mobile, Terra’s development team has been focused on technologies that can deliver an engaging mobile experience, and AMP presented itself as a slam-dunk strategic fit. “Since we had experience running a mobile version of the site from 2010 until 2014, we understood how critical fast performance is to engagement,” said Souza. “AMP offered the promise of a faster, easier-to-use mobile web for our readers and our advertisers. And we rushed to adopt it as soon as possible.”<br><br>Working with the Terra Brazil team, Souza and his colleagues began creating the AMP framework, launching AMP pages in the fall of 2016. AMP development, testing, and implementation was completed in two weeks by two engineers.
