    text: In late 2016, the company began reading about AMP and the mobile web. “We decided to launch our first AMP project using the same JavaScript-adaptive approach we used with regular adaptations for desktop websites,” says Artiom Tsympov, Eski.mobi’s founder.<br><br>Working wholly in-house, the studio began offering AMP services to their clients. “We ask them to create a subdomain (amp.their-website.com) that forwards to our servers and add a single line of code to their canonical pages to point to the AMP version we generate,” Tsympov explains. “That gives us the ability to pull all the HTML content from a single page and convert it into a pre-defined, AMP-compatible template.” This straightforward approach lets Eski.mobi complete AMP projects quickly—often in as little as just five to seven business days.

    text: "Eski.mobi converted 50 websites to AMP in 2017. With each site, the studio looked for similar outcomes: “We analyze clickthrough rates (CTR) and conversion rates before and after launching AMP,” Tsympov says. Results so far have been impressive: Bookseller AlpinaBook saw a 29% increase in CTR and a 170% increase in purchases Coins and currency marketplace Monetnik saw a 29% increase in CTR and lowered bounce rate by 20% Online marketing publisher Cossa increased page-load speed 10X and time on site by 150%<br><br>“A site made with AMP is loaded in one second,” Tsympov says. “This significantly increases conversions and reduces bounce rate.” AMP sites often see an increase in traffic as well.<br><br>Russian businesses are still getting to know AMP, and many don’t yet realize it’s usefulness for e-commerce. “Apart from implementing the technology, our job is also educating businesses about AMP and the importance of serving fast pages,” Tsympov says. “We're experimenting with a DIY tool to create AMP versions for any website, which we hope will help increase the number of AMP sites created every day.”"
