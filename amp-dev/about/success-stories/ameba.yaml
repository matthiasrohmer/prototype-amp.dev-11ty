    text: "<ul>
      <li>Leveraged the default AMP components as much as possible to accelerate development</li>
      <li>Re-used the existing landing pages as the single source of truth to automatically publish stories for 185 categories, which would become 185 individual stories, and keep it maintainable at the same time</li>
      <li>Followed the best practices for creating an AMP Story and used the auto-advance-after attribute to automatically transition to the next page to let users watch content just like a video channel</li>
      <li>Built a template with an A/B test approach to micro-optimize performance (in order to achieve the KPIs) and also publish at scale</li>
