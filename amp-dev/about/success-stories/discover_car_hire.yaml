    text: "Today’s travelers are able to access everything from hotel reservations to restaurant recommendations at the tap of a finger, and they expect these experiences to be swift, simple, and secure. Car rental comparison website DiscoverCarHire.com, which helps travelers in more than 150 countries find the best car to fit their needs, saw that 40% of all visits were coming from mobile. But even though there was an increase in traffic on mobile, the brand wasn’t seeing an increase in rentals."

    text: "DiscoverCarHire.com believed that its high bounce rate and low conversion rate on mobile was due to its lagging mobile site speed. To become a destination for travelers on the go, the rental site prioritized speeding up its mobile load time on key landing pages to improve user experience and, in turn, help drive conversions."
