In this section, we'll go through and resolve the AMP validation errors from our AMP page.  Note that the errors may appear in a different order in your console.

## Include charset

We will begin by fixing the following error:

<pre class="error-text">
The mandatory tag 'meta charset=utf-8' is missing or incorrect.
</pre>

To correctly display text, AMP requires that you specify the charset for the page. The meta charset information must also be the first child of the `<head> ` tag. The reason this tag must be first is to avoid re-interpreting content that was added before the meta charset tag.

**Add** the following code as the first line of the `<head>` tag:

```html
<meta charset="utf-8" />
```

**Save** the file and reload the page. Verify that the charset error no longer appears.

## Include canonical link

Now, let's look at the following error:

<pre class="error-text">
The mandatory tag 'link rel=canonical' is missing or incorrect.
</pre>

Every AMP document needs to have a link referencing the "canonical" version of that document.  We'll learn more about what canonical pages are and different approaches to canonical linking in the [Making your page discoverable](discoverable.md) step of this tutorial.

For this tutorial we'll consider the original HTML article that we're converting to be the canonical page.

Go ahead and **add** the following code below the `<meta charset="utf-8" />` tag:

```html
<link rel="canonical" href="/article.html">
```

[tip type="note"]
You can create a standalone canonical AMP page. The canonical link is still required, but should point to the AMP article itself:

```html
<link rel="canonical" href="article.amp.html">
```
[/tip]

Now, **reload** the page. Although there are still plenty of errors to fix, the  canonical link error is no longer present.

## Specify the AMP attribute

AMP requires an attribute on the root `<html>` element of a page to declare the page as an AMP document.

<pre class="error-text">
The mandatory attribute '⚡' is missing in tag 'html ⚡ for top-level html'
The mandatory tag 'html ⚡ for top-level html' is missing or incorrect.
</pre>

The above errors can be resolved by simply adding the `⚡ `attribute to the `<html>` tag like so:

```html
<html ⚡ lang="en">
```

Now, go ahead, reload the page and check that both errors are gone.

[tip type="note"]
Although specifying the `⚡` is the recommended approach, it's also possible to use the `amp` attribute in place of the `⚡` attribute, like so:

```html
<html amp lang="en">
```
[/tip]

## Specify a viewport

Next, let's address the following error:

<pre class="error-text">
The mandatory tag 'meta name=viewport' is missing or incorrect.
</pre>

AMP requires the definition of a `width` and `minimum-scale` for the viewport. These values must be defined as `device-width` and `1`, respectively. The viewport is a common tag included in the `<head>` of an HTML page.

To resolve the viewport error, add the following HTML snippet to the `<head>` tag:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1">
```

The values specified for `width` and `minimum-scale` are the required values in AMP. Defining `initial-scale` is not mandatory but it’s a commonly included in mobile web development and it's recommended. You can read more about the viewport and responsive design in [Configure the Viewport](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/ConfigureViewport).

As before, **reload** the page and check if the error has disappeared.

## Replace external stylesheets

The following error is related to our use of stylesheets:

<pre class="error-text">
The attribute 'href' in tag 'link rel=stylesheet for fonts' is set to the invalid value 'base.css'.
</pre>

Specifically, this error is complaining about the following stylesheet link tag in our `<head>` tag:

```html
<link href="base.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

The problem is that this is an external stylesheet reference. In AMP, to keep the load times of documents as fast as possible, you cannot include external stylesheets. Instead, all stylesheet rules must be embedded in the AMP document using `<style amp-custom></style>` tags, or as inline styles.

```html
<style amp-custom>

/* The content from base.css */

</style>
```

So, let's resolve the error:

1.  **Remove** the `<link>` tag pointing to the stylesheet in the `<head>` and replace it with an inline `<style amp-custom></style>` tag. The `amp-custom` attribute on the style tag is mandatory.
2. **Copy** all the styles from the [`base.css`](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/accelerated-mobile-pages-foundations/blob/master/base.css) file into the `<style amp-custom></style>` tags.

Once again, **reload** the page and verify that the stylesheets error has disappeared.

[tip type="note"]
**NOTE –**  Not only is embedded styling required but there is a file size limit of 50 kilobytes for all styling information. You should use CSS preprocessors such as [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) to minify your CSS before inlining the CSS in your AMP pages.
[/tip]

[tip type="important"]
**IMPORTANT –** You can only have one style tag in your entire AMP document. If you have several external stylesheets referenced by your AMP pages, you will need to collate these stylesheets into a single set of rules. To learn what CSS rules are valid in AMP, read [Supported CSS](../../../../documentation/guides-and-tutorials/develop/style_and_layout/style_pages.md).
[/tip]

## Exclude third-party JavaScript

While stylesheets can be reworked relatively easily with AMP by inlining the CSS, the same is not true for JavaScript.

<pre class="error-text">
The tag 'script' is disallowed except in specific forms.
</pre>

In general, scripts in AMP are only allowed if they follow two major requirements:

1.  All JavaScript must be asynchronous (i.e., include the `async` attribute in the script tag).
2.  The JavaScript is for the AMP library and for any AMP components on the page.

This effectively rules out the use of all user-generated/third-party JavaScript in AMP except as noted below.

[tip type="note"]
The only exceptions to the restriction on user-generated/third-party scripts are:

1.  Script that adds metadata to the page or that configures AMP components. These will have the type attribute  `application/ld+json` or `application/json`.
2.  Script included in iframes.  Including JavaScript in an iframe should be considered a measure of last resort. Wherever possible, JavaScript functionality should be replaced by using [AMP components](../../../../documentation/components/index.html). We will explore our first AMP component in the next section.
[/tip]

Try opening the external [`base.js`](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/accelerated-mobile-pages-foundations/blob/master/base.js) file. What do you see? The file should be empty of any JavaScript code and only include a comment of information such as this:

```javascript
/*

This external JavaScript file is intentionally empty.

Its purpose is merely to demonstrate the AMP validation error related to the
use of external JavaScript files.

*/
```

Considering that this external JavaScript file is not a functional component of our website, we can safely remove the reference entirely.

**Remove** the following external JavaScript reference from your document:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="base.js"></script>
```

Now, **reload** the page and verify that the script error has disappeared.

## Include AMP CSS boilerplate

The following errors reference missing boilerplate code:

<pre class="error-text">
The mandatory tag 'noscript enclosure for boilerplate' is missing or incorrect.
The mandatory tag 'head > style : boilerplate' is missing or incorrect.
The mandatory tag 'noscript > style : boilerplate' is missing or incorrect.
</pre>

Every AMP document requires the following AMP boilerplate code:

```html
<style amp-boilerplate>body{-webkit-animation:-amp-start 8s steps(1,end) 0s 1 normal both;-moz-animation:-amp-start 8s steps(1,end) 0s 1 normal both;-ms-animation:-amp-start 8s steps(1,end) 0s 1 normal both;animation:-amp-start 8s steps(1,end) 0s 1 normal both}@-webkit-keyframes -amp-start{from{visibility:hidden}to{visibility:visible}}@-moz-keyframes -amp-start{from{visibility:hidden}to{visibility:visible}}@-ms-keyframes -amp-start{from{visibility:hidden}to{visibility:visible}}@-o-keyframes -amp-start{from{visibility:hidden}to{visibility:visible}}@keyframes -amp-start{from{visibility:hidden}to{visibility:visible}}</style><noscript><style amp-boilerplate>body{-webkit-animation:none;-moz-animation:none;-ms-animation:none;animation:none}</style></noscript>
```

**Add** the boilerplate code to the bottom of the `<head>` tag of your document.

The `<style amp-boilerplate>`  tag initially hides the content of the body until the AMP JavaScript library is loaded, then the content is rendered. AMP does this to prevent unstyled content from rendering, also known as Flash Of Unstyled Content (FOUC). This helps ensure that the user experience feels truly instant as the page’s content appears all at once and everything above the fold is rendered together. The second tag reverts this logic if JavaScript is disabled in the browser.

## Replace `<img>` with `<amp-img>`

AMP doesn't support the default HTML counterparts to displaying media, which explains the following error:

<pre class="error-text">
The tag 'img' may only appear as a descendant of tag 'noscript'. Did you mean 'amp-img'?
</pre>

AMP has a web component specifically designed to replace the `<img>` tag, it's the [`<amp-img>`](../../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-img.md) tag:

```html
<amp-img src="mountains.jpg"></amp-img>
```

**Replace** the `<img>` tag with the above [`<amp-img>`](../../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-img.md) tag and run the validator again. You should receive several new errors:

<pre class="error-text">
Layout not supported: container
The implied layout 'CONTAINER' is not supported by tag 'amp-img'.
</pre>

Why did [`amp-img`](../../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-img.md) trigger another error? Because [`amp-img`](../../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-img.md) is not a direct substitute of the traditional HTML img tag. There are additional requirements when using [`amp-img`](../../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-img.md).

### AMP layout system

The layout error is telling us that [`amp-img`](../../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-img.md) does not support the `container` layout type. One of the most important concepts in AMP’s design is its focus on reducing the amount of DOM reflow required to render its web pages.

To reduce DOM reflow, AMP includes a layout system to ensure the layout of the page is known as early as possible in the lifecycle of downloading and rendering the page.

The image below compares how an HTML page is often laid out compared to the approach AMP enforces.  Notice in the approach on the left how the text reflows each time an ad or image is loaded.  AMP's approach to layout keeps the text from moving around--even if the images and ads take a long time to load.

{{ image('/static/img/docs/tutorials/tut-convert-html-layout-system.png', 837, 394, align='', caption="A comparison between how content is normally laid out and AMP's approach") }}

The AMP layout system allows for elements on a page to be positioned and scaled in a variety of ways -- fixed dimensions, responsive design, fixed height and more.

In the case of our article, the layout system inferred the layout type for the [`amp-img`](../../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-img.md) as the `container` type. However, the `container` type is only applicable to elements that contain children elements. The `container` type is incompatible with the [`amp-img`](../../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-img.md) tag, which is the reason for this error.

Why was the `container` type inferred? Because we did not specify a `height` attribute for the [`amp-img`](../../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-img.md) tag. In HTML, reflow can be reduced by always specifying a fixed width and height for elements on a page. In AMP, you need to define the width and height for [`amp-img`](../../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-img.md) elements so that AMP can pre-determine the aspect ratio of the element.

**Add** the `width` and `height` to your [`amp-img`](../../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-img.md) tag as follows:

```html
<amp-img src="mountains.jpg" width="266" height="150"></amp-img>
```

Refresh the page and check the validator; you should no longer see any errors!

You now have a valid AMP document, but the image doesn’t look so great because it is awkwardly positioned on the page.  By default when you specify the height and width for an [`amp-img`](../../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-img.md) AMP will fix the dimensions to what you specify--but wouldn't it be great if AMP would scale the image to *responsively* stretch and fit the page no matter the screen size?

{{ image('/static/img/docs/tutorials/tut-convert-html-not-responsive.png', 412, 660, align='center third', caption="Our image isn't responsive.") }}

Fortunately AMP can figure out the aspect ratio of elements from the width & height you specify.  This allows the AMP layout system to position and scale the element in a variety of ways.  The `layout` attribute informs AMP of how you want the element positioned and scaled.

Let's **set** the layout attribute to `responsive` so that our image scales and resizes:

```html
<amp-img src="mountains.jpg" layout="responsive" width="266" height="150"></amp-img>
```

Voila! Our image is in the correct aspect ratio and responsively fills the width of the screen.

## Success!

Now your AMP document should look something like this:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html ⚡ lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1">

    <link rel="canonical" href="/article.html">
    <link rel="shortcut icon" href="amp_favicon.png">

        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
      }

      header {
        background: Tomato;
        color: white;
        font-size: 2em;
        text-align: center;
      }

      h1 {
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0.5em;
        background: white;
        box-shadow: 0px 3px 5px grey;
      }

      p {
        padding: 0.5em;
        margin: 0.5em;
      }
    </style>
    <script async src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0.js"></script>

      <amp-img src="mountains.jpg" layout="responsive" width="266" height="150"></amp-img>
    </article>
  </body>
</html>
```

Refresh the page and look at the console output. You should be greeted with the following message:

<pre class="success-text">
AMP validation successful.
</pre>
