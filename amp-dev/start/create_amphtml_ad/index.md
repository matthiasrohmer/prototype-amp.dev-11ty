In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create an [AMPHTML ad](../../../../documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/intro-to-amphtml-ads.md) from scratch that can be served to AMP and non-AMP pages. The ad format used in this tutorial is a simple image ad.

AMPHTML ads are similar to traditional HTML ads, but instead of coding them in traditional HTML, they are coded in AMPHTML, according to the [AMPHTML ad spec](../../../../documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/a4a_spec.md). By creating the ads in AMPHTML, the ads take advantage of the same optimizations and performance utilized in AMP pages, making them a faster, lighter and a more secure way to advertise on the web. Most of all, these ads can be delivered anywhere on the web, _not just on AMP pages_.

## You will learn to:

* Create a valid AMPHTML ad according to the [AMPHTML ad spec](../../../../documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/a4a_spec.md)
* Track ad views by using the [`amp-pixel`](../../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-pixel.md) component
* Verify the AMPHTML ad syntax by using the [AMP validator](https://validator.ampproject.org/#htmlFormat=AMP4ADS)

## Prerequisites:

* A basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* A browser and text editor of your choice
