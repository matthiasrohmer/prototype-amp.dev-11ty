In this tutorial, we'll introduce you to the [`amp-story`](../../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-story.md) component, which you can use to create visually engaging stories in AMP. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have created a story about "The Joy of Pets" that provides bite-sized information and visuals to entertain and engage readers.

## You will learn to:

- Create a multi-page story by using the [`amp-story`](../../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-story.md) component
- Create visual effects with multiple layers in a page
- Lay out elements in a page by using layer templates
- Add audio that plays while a page is viewed
- Animate elements on a page
- Keep readers engaged with your content by adding related links to the end of the story
