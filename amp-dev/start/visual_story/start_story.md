An entire story is represented by the [`amp-story`](../../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-story.md) component, which serves as a container for all the pages in a story.  The [`amp-story`](../../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-story.md) component is also responsible for creating the UI shell, including handling gestures and navigation.

The [`amp-story`](../../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-story.md) component is a custom AMP component, and like all custom components, you must add the associated script for the component to the AMP document.

**Open** the `pets.html` file in your text editor, and in the `<head>` section, **add** the following script:

```html hl_lines="2 3"
<head>
<script async custom-element="amp-story"
        src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/amp-story-1.0.js"></script>
</head>
```

**Add** the `<amp-story>` element to the `<body>` of your document, and specify the mandatory `standalone` attribute, like so:

```html hl_lines="2 3"
<body>
  <amp-story standalone>
  </amp-story>
</body>
```

It's important to note that to have a valid AMP story, the `<body>` element must have only one child&mdash;the [`amp-story`](../../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-story.md) component; all other elements are contained in the [`amp-story`](../../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-story.md).

## Providing meta information

For stories to be discovered in the AMP stories ecosystem, certain metadata is required to provide mini details of the story, like:

* The title of the story, represented by the `title` attribute (e.g., "Joy of Pets").
* The name of the publisher, represented by the `publisher` attribute (e.g., "AMP tutorials").
* The publisher's logo, represented by the `publisher-logo-src` attribute.  This is a URL for a logo image, in square format with a 1x1 aspect ratio.
* A poster image of the story, represented by the `poster-portrait-src` attribute. This is a URL for the poster, and the image must be in portrait format with a 3x4 aspect ratio.

Let's add these attributes to our [`amp-story`](../../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-story.md) tag:

```html hl_lines="2 3 4 5"
<amp-story standalone
    title="Joy of Pets"
    publisher="AMP tutorials"
    publisher-logo-src="assets/AMP-Brand-White-Icon.svg"
    poster-portrait-src="assets/cover.jpg">
```

In addition to these required attributes, there are other attributes you can apply. To learn more, see the [attributes](../../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-story.md#attributes) section of the [`amp-story`](../../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-story.md) reference documentation.

[tip type="note"]
**NOTE â€“**  These metadata attributes supplement and do not replace any Structured Data (e.g. JSON-LD) on the page. To ensure your AMP pages are discovered across all platforms, you should add [Structured Data](../../../../documentation/guides-and-tutorials/optimize-measure/discovery.md#integrate-with-third-party-platforms-through-additional-metadata) to all your AMP pages, including AMP stories.
[/tip]

At this point, we have a shell of a story without any content. Let's create that page.
