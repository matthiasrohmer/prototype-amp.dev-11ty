In this tutorial, you'll build on your understanding of AMP foundations and learn how AMP handles advertising, analytics, embedded videos, social media integration, carousels, and more. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have created a mobile news article that includes these features.

## You’ll learn to:

- Display ads by using [`amp-ad`](../../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-ad.md)
- Embed YouTube videos, Twitter cards and responsive text elements
- Build carousels with images and combinations of content by using [`amp-carousel`](../../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-carousel.md)
- Track simple patterns with [`amp-analytics`](../../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-analytics.md)
- Add site navigation to your page with [`amp-sidebar`](../../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-sidebar.md)
- Use custom fonts in AMP

## You'll build:

A news article page that conforms to AMP specifications and incorporates advertising, analytics, embedded video, embedded social media, carousels, and a site navigation menu.
