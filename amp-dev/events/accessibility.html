    <h3>AMP Event Accessibility</h3>

    <p>All AMP events are meant to be inclusive and want to be accessible.</p>

    <p>We make sure that all our events are well accessible to people with physical disabilities, by both checking with the venue owner and by visiting them personally beforehand.</p>

    <p>However, we are aware that accessibility issues are diverse and this does not cover everything.</p>

    <p>If you are interested in our event, but have any kind of accessibility problem that needs to be resolved before you can attend, please <a href="mailto:wg-outreach@amp.dev">get in contact</a>.</p>

    <p>If you are in need of an assistant, they will not be required to request a ticket.</p>

    <p>We would love to welcome you to AMP Event!</p>
