Hreflang is a part of the meta data of a website and is used\nto annotate a page such that crawlers can discover alternative translations of\na particular article. Search engines such as Google recognise websites that use hreflang.\nThe hreflang notation is used with the link tag to refer to another document:\n\n```<link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"fr\" href=\"https://www.example.com/path/to/french.html\" />```\n\nAMP documents can also use the hreflang notation to point crawlers towards\nother versions of themselves in other languages.\n\nIt's important, however, to set up the hreflang relationships among all\nAMP documents correctly - especially the existing metadata\nrelationships between canonical documents and AMP documents. Below are two examples\nof how websites might structure their hreflang relationships for canonical and AMP\ndocuments across an article.\n\n## Example 1: Canonical + AMP\n\nA common site structure pattern is pairing non-AMP canonical documents with AMP documents.\nThe following diagram illustrates how to provide translations for this structure:\n\n[<amp-img layout=\"responsive\" src=\"/static/samples/img/amp_hreflang_example_1.png\" width=\"960\" height=\"540\"></amp-img>](/static/samples/img/amp_hreflang_example_1.png)\n\nIn this diagram, there is an English canonical desktop document and\na corresponding AMP document. As per the official AMP Project documentation for\n[discovery and distribution](/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/start/create/prepare_for_discovery)\nthe English AMP document must include a link tag to the canonical document. Similarly, the\ncanonical document includes a corresponding link tag to the AMP document.\n\nAdditionally, this diagram includes French translations of both the canonical document\nand the AMP document. Therefore the documents must include link tags with `hreflang`\nattributes to connect the various alternative language versions of the canonical and\nAMP documents. The following rules apply:\n* Every canonical document must have a link tag with `rel=amphtml` pointing to\nits matching AMP document in the same language.\n* Every AMP document must have a link tag with `rel=canonical` pointing to\nits matching canonical desktop document, again, in the same language.\n* Every canonical document must have a link tag with `rel=alternate` and an\n`hreflang` attribute for each alternative language version of the canonical document.\n* Every AMP document must have a link tag with `rel=alternate` and an\n`hreflang` attribute for each alternative language version of the AMP document.\n\nTherefore, given an article with X language versions of itself\n(including English) each canonical document would include:\n* 1 link tag with `rel=amphtml`\n* And X link tags with `rel=alternate` and the `hreflang` attribute\n\n<a href=\"/static/samples/internationalization/basic/\">View the Example</a>\n\n## Example 2: Canonical + Alternate + AMP\nThe next example is an expanded version of the first example. This example includes\n3 versions of any given document in a given language:\n* A canonical desktop document\n* An alternate mobile site document\n* An AMP document\n\nThe following diagram illustrates how to provide translations for this structure:\n\n[<amp-img layout=\"responsive\" src=\"/static/samples/img/amp_hreflang_example_2.png\" width=\"960\" height=\"540\"></amp-img>](/static/samples/img/amp_hreflang_example_2.png)\n\nThe same rules from the previous example apply in this example with the addition of\nthe following rules:\n* Every canonical document must have a link tag with `rel=alternate` and no `hreflang` attribute\npointing to its matching alternate mobile document in the same language.\n* Every alternate mobile document must have a link tag with `rel=canonical` pointing to\nits matching canonical desktop document, again, in the same language.\n* Every alternate mobile document must have a link tag with `rel=alternate` and an\n`hreflang` attribute for each alternative language version of the alternate mobile document.\n\n<a href=\"/static/samples/internationalization/alternate/\">View the Example</a>\n\n-->\n</body>\n</html>","document":{"sections":[{"doc_":"","code":"\n<!doctype html>\n<html ⚡>\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n  <title>Internationalization</title>\n  <link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"http://localhost:8080/documentation/examples/guides/internationalization/index.html\">\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1\">\n  <script async src=\"https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0.js\"></script>\n  <style amp-boilerplate>body{-webkit-animation:-amp-start 8s steps(1,end) 0s 1 normal both;-moz-animation:-amp-start 8s steps(1,end) 0s 1 normal both;-ms-animation:-amp-start 8s steps(1,end) 0s 1 normal both;animation:-amp-start 8s steps(1,end) 0s 1 normal both}@-webkit-keyframes -amp-start{from{visibility:hidden}to{visibility:visible}}@-moz-keyframes -amp-start{from{visibility:hidden}to{visibility:visible}}@-ms-keyframes -amp-start{from{visibility:hidden}to{visibility:visible}}@-o-keyframes -amp-start{from{visibility:hidden}to{visibility:visible}}@keyframes -amp-start{from{visibility:hidden}to{visibility:visible}}</style><noscript><style amp-boilerplate>body{-webkit-animation:none;-moz-animation:none;-ms-animation:none;animation:none}</style></noscript>\n</head>\n<body>\n","preview":"","inBody":false,"id":0,"cachedMarkedDoc":false,"isLastSection":false,"isFirstSection":true,"commentOffset":0,"codeOffset":0,"headings":[],"storyPageId":"","currentHint":"","hints":[],"filters":null,"normalizedDoc_":""},{"doc_":"\n## Introduction\n\nHow to support [hreflang](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/189077?hl=en) and internationalization with AMP.\nInternationalization and localization of content is an important feature that\nwebsites often embrace to provide maximum reach for their content or services.\n\nFor static websites, a common site structure technique for addressing this is\nknown as 'hreflang'.
