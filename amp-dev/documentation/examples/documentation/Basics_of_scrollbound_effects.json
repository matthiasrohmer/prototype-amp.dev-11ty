We add an `amp-position-observer` element as child of the scene to monitor its progress through the viewport. Let's take a look at the details:</p>\n\n  - **`on:scroll`**: This event is triggered by position observer as the position of the scene is changed when user scrolls. The event provides a percentage value (decimal between 0 and 1) representing how far the scene is between the start and end of its progress through the viewport.\n  - **`spinAnimation.seekTo(percent=event.percent)`**: We will define an `amp-animation` that will do the spinning in the next step, here we are coupling `amp-position-observer` and `amp-animation` by triggering a `seekTo` action on the animation as `scroll` events occurs. This is how we specify that we like to progress through the animation timeline as the scene progresses through the viewport via scrolling.\n  - **`intersection-ratios`**: Defines how much of the scene should be visible in the viewport before `amp-position-observer` triggers any of its events. Here, we like the spinning to happen only when fidget spinner is fully visible so we set it to `1`.\n  -->\n  <div class=\"fidget-spinner-scene\">\n\n    <amp-position-observer on=\"scroll:spinAnimation.seekTo(percent=event.percent)\" intersection-ratios=\"1\" layout=\"nodisplay\">\n    </amp-position-observer>\n\n    <amp-img id=\"fidgetSpinnerImage\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1114\" layout=\"responsive\" src=\"/static/samples/img/fidget.png\" alt=\"Picture of a fidget spinner\"></amp-img>\n  </div>\n\n  <!--\n   Now we need to define the animation itself:\n\n   Fairly straightforward in this case, we want `fidgetSpinnerImage` to rotate 360 degrees, so we just define a `\"transform\": \"rotate(360deg)\"` as the last (and only) keyframe. Let's take a look at the details:\n\n   - **`id=\"spinAnimation\"`**: We need to give the animation an Id so we can reference it from postion observer.\n   - **`\"duration\": \"1\"`**: The value of `duration` is irrelevant in this case since we progress through the timeline via scrolling so we just set it to `1`\n   - **`\"direction\": \"reverse\"`**: This is needed due an iOS bug with Web Animations.\n   - **`\"animations\"`**: Here we can define one or more keyframe-based animations. In our case, we only need one.\n   - **`\"selector\"`**: `\"#fidgetSpinnerImage\"` is the selector that targets the fidget spinner for the animation.\n   - **`\"keyframes\":`** We define a `\"transform\": \"rotate(360deg)\"` as the last (and only) keyframe. Note that `amp-animation` automatically fills the first keyframe if not provided.\n\n   `amp-animation` has plenty of other features, please see [the API reference](/documentation/components/amp-animation) to learn more about `amp-animations`.\n  -->\n  <amp-animation id=\"spinAnimation\" layout=\"nodisplay\">\n    <script type=\"application/json\">\n      {\n        \"duration\": \"1\",\n        \"fill\": \"both\",\n        \"direction\": \"reverse\",\n        \"animations\": [\n          {\n            \"selector\": \"#fidgetSpinnerImage\",\n            \"keyframes\": [\n              { \"transform\": \"rotate(360deg)\" }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    </script>\n  </amp-animation>\n\n  <!--\n  ## Fade & Slide Transitions\n\n  Now that we have learned the basic core concepts behind `amp-position-observer` and `amp-animation`, let's dive into more creative ways they can be combined to create interesting transitions.\n\n  In this sample, we will combine timebound and scrollbound transitions together to create an effect where the opacity of the card is tied to how much of it is visible in the viewport (scrollbound) and the title of the card animates in/out (timebound) as the card enters and exits the viewport.</p>\n\n  Our card scene is simply composed of an image and an overlayed title. Here we define two position observers with different `intersection-ratios` values:\n\n  - The first one will control the opacity of the image as user scrolls.\n  - The second one will run a timebound slide animation for the title when the scene becomes mostly visible (80%) and runs it again \"in reverse\" when scene exits the viewport a bit (20%).\n  -->\n  <div class=\"card ampstart-card\">\n\n

layout=\"responsive\" src=\"/static/samples/img/food.jpg\" alt=\"Picture of food table.\"></amp-img>\n  </div>\n\n  <!--\n  Let's define the keyframes for the scrollbound fade in/out transition.\n\n  We target the `#cardImage` and define keyframes in a way that image gains full opacity within the first 40% of the timeline and starts fading out in the last 40% of the timeline.\n\n  Note that since the position observer controlling this animation has `intersection-ratios` set to `0`, we go through the full timeline when user scrolls `ViewportHeight + 2 * SceneHeight` amount of pixels.\n  -->\n

  </script>\n  </amp-animation>\n\n  <!--\n  For the slide in/out effect of the title, we just define a 500ms animation that will move the title along the X-axis.\n\n  This animation will simply be triggered (either in normal or reverse directions) via the second position observer when the scene is mostly visible/invisible.\n  -->\n  <amp-animation id=\"slideTransition\" layout=\"nodisplay\">\n    <script type=\"application/json\">\n      {\n          \"duration\": \"500ms\",\n          \"fill\": \"both\",\n          \"easing\": \"ease-out\",\n          \"iterations\": \"1\",\n

is possible with combining `amp-animation` and `amp-position-observer`.\n\n  Parallax normally involves translating an element on the Y-axis as user scrolls.\n\n  Here we define a scene that has a smaller height than the image inside of it, as user scrolls, we move the image creating a parallax window into the image.\n  -->\n  <div class=\"parallax-image-window\">\n\n    <amp-position-observer on=\"scroll:parallaxTransition.seekTo(percent=event.percent)\" intersection-ratios=\"0\" layout=\"nodisplay\">\n    </amp-position-observer>\n\n    <amp-img id=\"parallaxImage\" width=\"1280\" height=\"873\" layout=\"responsive\" src=\"/static/samples/img/elephant.jpg\" alt=\"Picture of an elephant\"></amp-img>\n  </div>\n\n  <!--\n  The animation itself simply moves the image up via `\"transform\": \"translateY(-30%)\"`\n  -->\n  <amp-animation id=\"parallaxTransition\" layout=\"nodisplay\">\n    <script type=\"application/json\">\n      {\n        \"duration\": \"1\",\n        \"fill\": \"both\",\n        \"direction\": \"reverse\",\n        \"animations\": [\n          {\n            \"selector\": \"#parallaxImage\",\n            \"keyframes\": [\n              {

other AMP components such as `amp-carousel`.\n\n  In this sample, we have a carousel where the first item is pushed to the right and when carousel becomes visible, it snaps back into place providing a visual \"hint\" that the carousel is horizontally scrollable.\n  -->\n  <div class=\"carousel-parent\">\n    <amp-carousel class=\"carousel-component\" height=\"300\" layout=\"fixed-height\" type=\"carousel\">\n\n      <amp-position-observer on=\"enter:carouselTransition.start\" intersection-ratios=\"0.8\" layout=\"nodisplay\">\n      </amp-position-observer>\n\n      <amp-img

</amp-carousel>\n  </div>\n\n  <!--\n  Here we define our timebound animation with a delay of 200ms which will slide the carousel to the left within 500ms.\n\n  This animation will only be triggered
