In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use data binding and expressions to build awesome, interactive AMP pages with [`amp-bind`](../../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-bind.md).

## What you'll build

You'll build an e-commerce product page that:

- Uses AMP HTML and AMP components for a fast and rich user experience.
- Includes cross-element interactivity by using [`amp-bind`](../../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-bind.md).
- Fetches additional product data on demand by using [`<amp-state>`](../../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-bind.md#state).
