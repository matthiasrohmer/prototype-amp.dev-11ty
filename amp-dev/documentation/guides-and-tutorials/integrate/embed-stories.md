Stories are a full-screen immersive experience. They’re hosted on the open web with their own URL, making them easily shareable. But, what if you want to integrate stories into your own site, for example, within a blog, product description or news article? 

The [AMP Story Player](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/spec/amp-story-player.md) enables you to embed stories that users are able to tap or click through, inside of a web page. Follow this step-by-step guide to learn how.

# Display stories in a non-AMP page

You can embed AMP stories inside a non-AMP page, allowing users to tap or click through the experience without leaving the host document!

## Embed AMP story player

Displaying an AMP story in a non-AMP page requires the use of the [`amp-story-player`](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/spec/amp-story-player.md) element. 

### Import scripts

Include the two required scripts in the head of your document:

```html
<script async src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/amp-story-player-v0.js">
<link href="https://cdn.ampproject.org/amp-story-player-v0.css" rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>
```

The first script imports the logic for the player and the second one sets the default styling.  

### Specify a story

Include the `<amp-story-player>` element inside the document `body`. Then specify the desired story by placing an `<a>` tag inside of the `<amp-story-player>` element. Point the `href` to the story’s location. The `href` may point to the URL of a hosted story or a relative path. Place the title of the story within the `<a>` tags.

```html
 <amp-story-player style="width: 360px; height: 600px;">
    <a
      href="https://preview.amp.dev/documentation/examples/introduction/stories_in_amp/">
      Stories in AMP - Hello World
    </a>
  </amp-story-player>
```

### Size the player

You may define the story player's `width`, `height`, and other styles inline or as you would any other element's style.

```html
<body>
...
  <amp-story-player style="width: 360px; height: 600px;">
...
  </amp-story-player>
...
</body>
```

We recommend maintaining a 3:5 aspect ratio for the best user experience, but you may define any width and height. 

#### Responsive sizing

The story player's responsiveness works as any other block element. Use CSS to maintain width and height ratios, such as the example below:

```html
<amp-story-player style="width: 50vw; height: 83.35vw;">
  ...
</amp-story-player>
```

### Provide a placeholder

Include a representative poster image by adding `style="--story-player-poster: url('...');"` to the story’s `<a>` tag, or by using the `--story-player-poster` CSS variable. The AMP story player displays this image while loading the full story. 

```html
<amp-story-player style="width: 50vw; height: 83.35vw;">
  <a
    href="https://www.example.com/story.html"
    style="--story-player-poster: url('https://www.example.com/assets/cover1.html');"
  >
    A title that describes this story.
  </a>
</amp-story-player>
```

For the best user experience, we strongly recommend including a poster image. If you do not include a poster image the story player will display a loader spinner with a grey background. 

## Embed multiple stories

You may add multiple stories in the same `<amp-story-player>` element by defining multiple `<a>` tags. The player presents the second story’s cover page after user’s tap through the first.

```html
<amp-story-player style="width: 360px; height: 600px;">
  <a
    href="https://www.example.com/story1.html"
    style="--story-player-poster: url('https://www.example.com/assets/cover1.html');"
  >
    A title that describes story 1.
  </a>
  <a
    href="https://www.example.com/story2.html"
    style="--story-player-poster: url('https://www.example.com/assets/cover2.html');"
  >
    A title that describes story 2.
  </a>
</amp-story-player>
```

You can embed as many instances of `<amp-story-player>` as desired. They display as individual viewers. 

```html
<amp-story-player style="width: 360px; height: 600px;">
  <a
    href="https://www.example.com/story1.html"
    style="--story-player-poster: url('https://www.example.com/assets/cover1.html');"
  >
    A title that describes story 1.
  </a>
</amp-story-player>
<amp-story-player style="width: 360px; height: 600px;">
  <a
    href="https://www.example.com/story2.html"
    style="--story-player-poster: url('https://www.example.com/assets/cover2.html');"
  >
    A title that describes story 2.
  </a>
</amp-story-player>
```

# Display stories in an AMP page

Currently, using the `<amp-story-player>` component in an AMP page invalidates it. We are currently working to support this component in AMP page! Follow our [progress on the roadmap](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/26308)!
